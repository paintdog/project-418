project 418
===========

The tools of this project help you to make screenshots (__make_screenshots.py), to find duplicates (__find_duplicates.py), to crop the screenshots (__crop_pictures.py) and then to rename the files (__rename_files.py). After these steps you can generate a gallery to show the files (__generate_galleries.py). If the last tool finds a content.txt file in the folder of your pictures it will generate a content file for your galleries. You can go through the gallery using the cursor keys. Have fun.
